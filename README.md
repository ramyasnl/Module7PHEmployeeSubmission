##Overview of the analysis##<br/>
Our aim here is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program using postgresql. <br/>
Also we write a report that summarizes the analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.<br/>
